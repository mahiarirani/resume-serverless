### Greetings, I'm not your typical developer 🚀

Consider me a tech enthusiast with a passion for web mastery! With over 7 years of experience, I've ventured deep into the coding universe, honing my skills in back-end wizardry with Python, Django, and more. I'm well-versed in conversing with databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite! 🗄️✨
